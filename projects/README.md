# MSNE Fundamentals of Computer Science Projects

## Goal
The goal of this part of the course is to apply what you have learned in the first part of the course, e.g., 

- using the terminal
- basic of Python
- numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas
- git, GitHub

on your own. 

To do so, you will work on a project by yourself with close supervision by us. 

## Projects

We have collected a set of projects you can choose from. However, you can also come up with your own project.
This could be a any programming problem you are working on at the moment, or a data analysis you are stuck with - 
as long as you can formulate it as a project with clearly stated problems and desired outcomes. 

### Machine learning projects

- M1: [Getting started with PyTorch](ml_projects/pytorch_mnist.md)
    - learn the basics of PyTorch to quickly implement neural networks to classify handwritten digits.

- M2: [The Perceptron](ml_projects/perceptrons.pdf)
    - understand the very first approaches to artificial neural networks - Perceptrons.
    - implement your own Perceptron from scratch.

- M3: [Kaggle New York City Taxi Trip Duration](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyc-taxi-trip-duration)
    - Learn the basics of the data science workflow in this classic Kaggle competition.

- M4: [Kaggle Leaf classification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/leaf-classification)

### Computational Neuroscience projects

These projects are taken from [a course in the Computational Neuroscience master program at BCCN Berlin](https://www.bccn-berlin.de/courses-and-modules.html#ui-id-11) (thanks @bccn). 
Please ignore all the information related to this, e.g., when to submit, and references to the corresponding lecture. 

- N1: [Visual Perception](neuro_projects/1visual_perception/1visual_perception.pdf)
    - Learn how to analyse the properties of natural images and how we process them.

- N2: [Saliency Maps](neuro_projects/2saliency/2saliency.pdf)
    - Learn how to build and apply saliency models to any input image. 

- N3**: [Perceptual Bistability](neuro_projects/3perceptual_bistability/3perceptual_bistability.pdf)
    - Implement and analyse two classical models of perceptual bistability using differential equations.

- N4**: [Perceptual Decision Making](neuro_projects/4decision_making/4decision_making.pdf)
    - Implement a classic model of perceptual decision making - the drift diffusion model
    - Learn how to solve partial differential equations in Python
