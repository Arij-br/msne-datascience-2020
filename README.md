Welcome to the Fundamentals of Computer Science for Computational Neuroengineering Couse. This is a git repository containing the course material. In the [course summary](course_summary.md) document you find an overview of the covered material with links to other resources (will be updated throughout the course).

You find notebooks with slides and exercises in the [notebooks](notebooks/) folder.

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/cne-tum/msne-datascience-2020.git
```

If there is anything unclear please create an issue.
