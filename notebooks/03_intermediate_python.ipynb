    "We briefly talked about this on Saturday during the lecture, but it's important so once again: If you are using Windows Subsystem for Linux, I would recommend the following:\n",
    "1. Make a new folder on Windows e.g. create `C:\\ubuntu\\`\n",
    "2. When you are on the Ubuntu terminal and want to work on a project, I would recommend switching to the path `/mnt/c/ubuntu/` and working in there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why? That way, you can access files that live inside WSL from Windows and Ubuntu. This might be handy for several things:\n",
    "1. If you prefer writing your code in an external editor, like [Atom](http://atom.io) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) this comes handy: You install the editor on Windows, store files in `C:\\ubuntu\\perhaps_some_subfolder` and can access them from your Ubuntu terminal by switching to `/mnt/c/ubuntu/perhaps_some_subfolder` e.g. to run Python on the script file.\n",
    "2. Your scripts or notebooks may eventually create outputs that you want to access from Windows, say, for example, your script or notebook creates some plots you need to use for a report or homework assignment. By working inside `/mnt/c/ubuntu` you can easily access files from Windows Explorer."
